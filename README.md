# Expense-Calculator-Web-App
Expense Calculator Web App, a web application helps you to track your expenses.

Created a robust but straightforward expense tracking system using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project allows you to effortlessly monitor your everyday expenses and observe your spending patterns.

Comments guide you through the process of constructing the application from the ground up. We begin with establishing the HTML structure and enhancing its appearance with CSS. Subsequently, I delve into the JavaScript code, demonstrating each step to introduce interactivity and features such as adding new expenses, calculating totals, and presenting the information in a clear and user-friendly manner.
